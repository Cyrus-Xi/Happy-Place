Happy-Place
===========

An iPhone app that consistently but randomly gives the user the compliments, other positive messages and happy memories that they have input.

Compliments are delivered to the user approximately every other day (specifically, at a random time within a 6-hour period) via notifications. The user can edit and delete their compliments.
